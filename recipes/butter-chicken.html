    <h2> Worlds Best Butter Chicken Recipe</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as Murgh Makhani, (pronounced [mʊrg ˈmək.kʰə.ni]) is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. In addition sometimes the cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture.</p>
    <p>It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
