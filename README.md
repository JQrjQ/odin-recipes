Recipe Website

This project is to practice my HTML knowledge but more importantly to get used to using GIT. I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a homepage with links to a few recipe pages.

**After completing this project, I have accomplished:**

* Correctly setting up HTML files
* Linked HTML files together
* Used images
* Used both Ordered and Unordered lists
* Added a Home page link to all pages
* Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files
